  # Generated with `brew generate-zap` after launching the app, not reasoned
  # about. The app is sandboxed, so its preferences, caches and saved state live
  # inside the container rather than at ~/Library/Preferences — listing those
  # conventional paths would be cargo cult. What genuinely sits outside the
  # sandbox is the Application Scripts directory, the LaunchServices recent-
  # documents list, and crash reports.
